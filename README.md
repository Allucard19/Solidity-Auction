# Solidity-Auction
This Auction solidity program is used for Fundraising for a Social Cause.
This progeram can be directly deployd to Ethereum network and work.

Program Logic:
The items for auctions are received and arranged each with a bowl 
to place the bid. A chairperson is a special person among the organizers. She/he heads the effort and is 
the only person who can determine the winner by random drawing at the end of the auction. A set of 
bidders buy sheets of tickets with their money. The bidder’s sheet has a stub that identifies the bidder’s 
number, and tokens bought.
The bidders examine the items to bid, place the one or more tickets in the bowl in front of the items they 
desire to bid for until all the tickets are used. After the auction period ends the chairperson, collects the 
bowls, randomly selects a ticket from each item’s bowl to determine the winning bidder for that item. The 
item is transferred to the winning bidder. Total money collected is the fund raised by the penny social 
auction.
